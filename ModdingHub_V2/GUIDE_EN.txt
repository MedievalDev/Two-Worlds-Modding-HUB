  TW1 MODDING HUB v2.0 — USER GUIDE
================================================================================


WHAT IS THE MODDING HUB?
────────────────────────
The TW1 Modding Hub is the central application for Two Worlds 1 modding.
It brings together all community tools, bilingual guides, and file format
documentation in one place. Instead of hunting through folders for the
right .py or .exe, you launch everything from the hub.


GETTING STARTED
───────────────
1. Place these files in a folder:

     YourFolder/
     ├── TW_ModdingHub.exe    (or tw1_modding_hub.py)
     └── guides/
         ├── editor_beginner_guide_en.txt
         ├── editor_beginner_guide_de.txt
         ├── dungeon_guide_part1_en.txt
         ├── dungeon_guide_part1_de.txt
         ├── dungeon_guide_part2_en.txt
         ├── dungeon_guide_part2_de.txt
         ├── map_to_mod_guide_en.txt
         └── map_to_mod_guide_de.txt

2. Run the hub:
     Double-click TW_ModdingHub.exe
     Or: python tw1_modding_hub.py

3. The hub opens centered on your screen (50% width, 65% height).

4. A config file (tw1_modding_hub.json) is created automatically on
   first run. It stores your settings, tool paths, and custom entries.


THE INTERFACE
─────────────
The hub has three main areas:

  TOP BAR
    Left:   Title
    Center: Search bar — searches tools, guides, AND file formats
    Right:  Credits, Settings, View toggle (Grid/List), Language (EN/DE)

  TOOLS TAB (🔧)
    Shows all registered tools as square cards in a 4-column grid.
    Each card shows: icon, name, status (Found/Not Found), description,
    supported file formats, and action buttons.

  GUIDES TAB (📖)
    Left panel: list of all guides (click to preview, double-click for
    full-screen popup). Right panel: preview of selected guide.


TOOL CARDS — HOW THEY WORK
───────────────────────────
Every tool has a status indicator:

  ● Found (green)
    The hub located the tool on your system.
    → Shows a green LAUNCH button. Click to start the tool.

  ● Not Found (red)
    The hub could not find the tool.
    → Shows two buttons:
      ⬇ Download — opens the GitHub/ModDB page in your browser
      📂 Set Path — lets you browse to the .exe/.py manually

Once you set a path manually, it is saved in the config file and
remembered for all future launches.


TOOL AUTO-DETECTION
───────────────────
The hub searches for tools in this order:

  1. Saved path from config (if you previously used "Set Path")
  2. Same directory as the hub
  3. One level up (../) and ../Tools/

If none of these work, the tool shows as "Not Found" and you can
either download it or browse to it manually.


REGISTERED TOOLS
────────────────
The hub ships with 11 pre-registered tools:

  MedievalDev Tools (Python):
    • TW Editor CMD Injector — console command injection
    • TW1 LAN Viewer — .lan language file viewer
    • TW1 Quest Editor — .idx/.qtx/.shf quest editing
    • TW1 PAR Tool — .par parameter database editor
    • TW1 VDF In/Export Tool — .vdf 3D model import/export
    • TW1 LND Viewer — .lnd level/map file viewer
    • TW1 Modding Guide — interactive step-by-step guide

  SDK Tools (Executables):
    • TwoWorlds Editor — the official SDK level editor
    • WhizzEdit — Reality Pump's quest authoring tool

  Buglord's Tools (Executables):
    • Mod Selector — toggle mods on/off via registry
    • WD Repacker — pack/unpack .wd mod archives


ADDING CUSTOM TOOLS
───────────────────
Click the "+ Add Tool" button at the bottom of the Tools tab.

Fill in:
  • Tool Name (required)
  • Path to the .py or .exe file
  • Supported file formats (comma-separated, e.g. ".lan,.par")
  • Description in English and/or German
  • Download link (optional)

Click Save. The tool appears immediately as a new card.


GUIDES — BUILT-IN
──────────────────
The hub includes 6 guides:

  Loaded from external files (in the guides/ folder):
    1. Editor Beginner Guide — complete editor reference with
       shortcuts, terrain, textures, objects, markers, console
    2. Dungeon Guide Part 1 — manual dungeon creation method
    3. Dungeon Guide Part 2 — SDK Dungeon Editor (block-based)
    4. Map-to-Mod Guide — full workflow from editor to .wd mod

  Embedded in the hub (always available):
    5. PhysX Cooking Reference — the 4 commands + warnings
    6. File Format Overview — all formats and which tool handles each

All guides are available in English AND German. The language switches
with the globe button in the top bar.


GUIDE AUTO-DISCOVERY
────────────────────
This is one of the hub's most useful features:

  The hub scans the guides/ folder every time it loads. Any .txt or
  .md file it finds that is NOT already a built-in guide gets added
  automatically to the guide list.

To add a new guide:
  1. Write your guide as a .txt or .md file
  2. Drop it into the guides/ folder
  3. Restart the hub (or switch tabs)
  4. Your guide appears with a green "📂 Auto" label

For bilingual guides, use the naming convention:
  my_guide_en.txt    ← English
  my_guide_de.txt    ← German

The hub pairs them automatically. If only one language exists,
it is used for both.

The guide title is generated from the filename:
  my_cool_guide_en.txt  →  "My Cool Guide"

The guides/ folder name is auto-detected. The hub checks for:
  guides/  Guids/  Guides/  guids/


ADDING CUSTOM GUIDES (via UI)
─────────────────────────────
Click "+ Add Guide" at the bottom of the Guides tab.

Fill in:
  • Title (English, required + optional German)
  • Tags (comma-separated, for search)
  • Related tools (comma-separated tool names)
  • Content (type directly or load from a .txt/.md file)

Both English and German content fields are available.


SEARCH
──────
The search bar in the top bar searches across:
  • Tool names and descriptions
  • File format extensions and descriptions
  • Guide titles and tags

Type any keyword and the Tools and Guides tabs filter in real-time.
Clear the search to show everything again.


FILE FORMAT DATABASE
────────────────────
The hub documents all Two Worlds 1 file formats. When you search
for a format extension (e.g. ".wd" or ".phx"), the tools that
handle that format are highlighted.

  .wd   — Mod archive (zlib, GUID). .phx must NOT be compressed!
  .lan  — Language file (16,194 translations, binary, UTF-16-LE)
  .par  — Parameter database (items, NPCs, skills, zlib-compressed)
  .lnd  — Level/map (terrain, objects, spawns, 128x128 tiles)
  .vdf  — 3D model (mesh, textures, animations)
  .phx  — Physics/collision (cook in editor, never compress!)
  .lhc  — LevelHeaders cache (regenerate after every map change)
  .idx  — Quest data (SOAP-XML export from WhizzEdit)
  .qtx  — Quest logic (plaintext, compiled for engine)
  .shf  — WhizzEdit project (.NET binary, read-only in our tools)
  .bmp  — Minimap image (one per map tile)


SETTINGS
────────
Click the ⚙ Settings button in the top bar.

  General:
    • Language — English or German (affects UI + guides)
    • Font Size — 8 to 18 (affects guide text)
    • View Mode — Grid (square cards) or List
    • Guides Folder — path to the guides directory

  Tool Paths:
    All registered tools are listed with their current path.
    Green dot = found, hollow dot = not found.
    For each tool you can:
      • Browse (...) to set a custom path
      • Clear (x) to reset the path

Click Save to apply. Settings are stored in tw1_modding_hub.json.


VIEW MODES
──────────
  Grid View (default):
    Square cards in a 4-column layout. Compact display with icon,
    name, short description, format tags, and action buttons.

  List View:
    Full-width cards with complete descriptions and related guide
    links. Better for reading, worse for quick overview.

Toggle with the Grid/List button in the top bar.

TROUBLESHOOTING
───────────────

Problem                          Solution
───────────────────────────────  ─────────────────────────────────
Hub window is too small          Drag to resize. The window starts
                                 at 50% width, 65% height. Minimum
                                 size is 800x400.

Tool shows "Not Found"           Click "Set Path" and browse to the
                                 .exe or .py file. The path is saved
                                 permanently.

Guides folder not detected       The hub checks for guides/, Guids/,
                                 Guides/, guids/ next to the .py/.exe.
                                 Or set a custom path in Settings.

Guide shows fallback text        The .txt file is missing from the
                                 guides folder. Re-download the guide
                                 files and place them in the folder.

New guide file not appearing     Make sure the file has a .txt or .md
                                 extension. Restart the hub or switch
                                 between tabs.

Config file corrupted            Delete tw1_modding_hub.json and
                                 restart. A fresh config is created
                                 automatically.

Tool launches but crashes        Check that Python 3.10+ is installed
                                 and the tool's dependencies are met.
                                 Some tools need specific pip packages.

Search finds nothing             Try shorter keywords. Search checks
                                 tool names, descriptions, format
                                 extensions, and guide tags.
