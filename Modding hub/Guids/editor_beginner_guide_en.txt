  TWO WORLDS 1 — Editor Beginner Guide  (Comprehensive Reference)
================================================================================

OVERVIEW
────────
The TwoWorldsEditor is the official level editor for Two Worlds 1,
included in the TwoWorlds SDK version 1.3. It was the primary tool
used by Reality Pump Studios to build the game's open world, and it
is the only tool available for creating custom maps and mods for
Two Worlds 1.

The editor is a fully featured 3D level design tool that allows you
to sculpt terrain, paint textures, place objects, configure weather
and sky, set up NPC encounters, and design both surface and
underground levels. It also includes a console system for advanced
operations and batch processing.

This guide covers everything a new user needs to know to get started
with the editor, from installation to placing your first objects.
For exporting your map as a playable mod, see the companion guide
"TW1 Map to Mod Conversion Guide". For creating dungeons and caves,
see the "TW1 Dungeon Creation Guide (Part 1 & 2)".


IMPORTANT NOTES BEFORE YOU START
─────────────────────────────────
  • The SDK was built for game version 1.6. The current game version
    is 1.7 (Epic Edition on Steam/GOG). Most editor features work
    fine with 1.7, but be aware of potential minor incompatibilities.

  • The SDK comes with all paths hardcoded to:
      D:\Games\TwoWorldsSDK  (for the SDK)
      D:\Games\TwoWorlds     (for the game)
    If your installation is different, you will need to update paths
    in .bat, .reg, and .xls files accordingly.

  • Some SDK tools require PhysX DLLs from the game directory. Either
    copy those DLLs to the Tools folder or add your game directory to
    the system PATH environment variable.

  • Reality Pump's own note from the SDK: "We give you this SDK
    'as it is' and you must be aware that game wasn't especially
    prepared for handling mods." Keep this in mind — some things are
    experimental and may not work perfectly.

  • If playing with mods, install the 4GB Patch from ntcore.com to
    avoid memory-related crashes. Steam users: create a desktop
    shortcut from the game folder — the 4GB Patch does not work
    with the Steam launcher shortcut.

================================================================================
================================================================================

For impatient modders who want to see results fast. This section gets
you from zero to a basic map in the shortest time possible. Read the
detailed sections afterwards for the full picture.


STEP 1 — Launch the Editor
───────────────────────────
Open TwoWorldsEditor.exe from TwoWorldsSDK\Tools\.
Make sure NumLock is ON (the editor relies heavily on the NumPad).


STEP 2 — Create a New Level
────────────────────────────
Go to File → New.
Then immediately go to Tools → Properties and set:
  • Level Name:       Give it any name (e.g. "MyFirstMap")
  • Level File Name:  Use the naming convention, e.g. "Map_F01"
  • Size:             Medium (128x128) — this is the standard
  • Underground:      Leave UNCHECKED (surface map)
Click OK.


STEP 3 — Sculpt the Terrain
────────────────────────────
Click the "Terrain Shape and Texture" button on the Mode Selection
Bar (the mountain icon on the left side toolbar).

The left panel shows brush options:
  • Shape:  Select a brush shape (circular, square, etc.)
  • Size:   Adjust the brush radius
  • Power:  How strong the sculpting effect is

Left-click and drag on the terrain to raise it. Hold Shift + Left
click to lower terrain. Move around with the Arrow Keys, zoom with
Page Up / Page Down.

Create a few hills, a valley, whatever you like.


STEP 4 — Paint Textures
────────────────────────
Still in Terrain Shape and Texture mode, the left panel also shows
texture slots. Click on a texture slot to select it, then paint on
the terrain with Left Mouse Button.

To change textures: Click the "Setup textures set" button at the top
of the panel. This opens the Texture Set Manager where you can browse
and assign different terrain textures (grass, rock, dirt, sand, etc.).

Select a texture set from the right-hand list (e.g. one of the
predefined game sets), then close the manager and start painting.


STEP 5 — Place Objects
───────────────────────
Click the "Objects" button on the Mode Selection Bar (the cube icon).

The left panel now shows the Objects browser. Browse through the
categories — Environment, Buildings, Furniture, Characters, etc.

Click on an object to select it. Left-click on the terrain to place
it. Use the NumPad to adjust:

  Numpad 5     Select/pick up nearest object
  Numpad +/-   Raise / Lower
  Numpad 7/9   Move left / right
  Numpad 1/3   Move forward / back
  Numpad /     X axis rotate (left)
  Numpad *     X axis rotate (right)
  Numpad 4/6   Y axis rotate
  Numpad 8/2   Z axis rotate
  Numpad Del   Deselect

Place a few trees, rocks, and maybe a building.


STEP 6 — Test It
─────────────────
Press Alt+H (or Tools → Game hero & camera) to drop the game
character into your level. Move around with WASD to see your
creation from the player's perspective. Press Alt+H again to
exit hero mode.


STEP 7 — Save
──────────────
Press Ctrl+S or File → Save. The editor saves to the Saves\Levels\
folder inside the SDK/Game directory.

To play your map as a mod, follow the "TW1 Map to Mod Conversion
Guide" (cook PhysX, generate LevelHeaders, pack .wd, activate).


DONE! You now have a basic map. Read on for the full details on
every feature.

                                Requires .NET Framework 2.0.

SDK DEFAULT PATHS
─────────────────
All batch files, registry files, and Excel macros use these paths:

  SDK:   D:\Games\TwoWorldsSDK
  Game:  D:\Games\TwoWorlds

If your paths differ, you must update:
  • All .bat files (LevelHeadersCacheGen.bat, MeshParamsGen.bat, etc.)
  • All .reg files (ParticleEdit.reg, EarthCdbg.reg, TreesGenerator.reg)
  • The .xls parameter files

COPY THE GAME FOLDER
─────────────────────
The Game\ directory from the SDK contains console scripts the editor
needs at runtime. Copy its contents to your actual game directory, or
the editor's console commands may not work.


================================================================================

                           determines the .lnd file name and must
                           follow the game's naming convention for
                           the mod system to work.

  Size                     The dimensions of the level tile:
                             Small    = 64 x 64
                             Medium   = 128 x 128  ← STANDARD
                             Large    = 256 x 256
                             Custom   = any value (may crash above 512)

                           Use Medium (128x128) for standard game-
                           compatible levels. All vanilla map tiles
                           are this size and fit together like a grid.

  Underground Level        Checkbox — check this to mark the level as
                           an underground map (dungeon/cave). This
                           changes the rendering mode and enables
                           dungeon-specific features.
                           (See Dungeon Guide for full details.)

  Connected Levels         Six fields representing the levels connected
                           to this one in a grid pattern:

                             ┌───────┬───────┬───────┐
                             │       │ Upper │       │
                             ├───────┼───────┼───────┤
                             │ Left  │ THIS  │ Right │
                             ├───────┼───────┼───────┤
                             │       │ Lower │       │
                             └───────┴───────┴───────┘

                           For surface-to-dungeon links:
                             Lower = underground level filename
                             Upper = surface level filename (set in
                                     the underground level's properties)

MAP NAMING CONVENTION
─────────────────────
Two Worlds uses a grid coordinate system for map tiles:

  Map_[Letter][Number].lnd
  Examples: Map_A01, Map_B05, Map_F03

Letters represent columns (East-West), numbers represent rows
(North-South). When creating mods that replace vanilla maps, your
files must use the exact same names as the originals.

For new custom maps used in standalone mods, you can use any valid
name following the Map_ prefix convention.


================================================================================
  SECTION 5 — WORLD CONFIGURATION  (Sky, Weather & Templates)
================================================================================

Access via: Tools → World Configuration (or the 🌍 icon).

The World Configuration dialog controls the visual atmosphere of
your level — sky, clouds, lighting, fog, wind, and weather.

KEY FEATURES
────────────
  • Sky dome and cloud layer settings
  • Ambient and directional lighting
  • Fog distance and density
  • Wind speed and direction (affects grass and particle systems)
  • Day/night cycle parameters
  • Weather presets (clear, rain, storm, etc.)

For surface levels, these settings define the outdoor atmosphere.
For underground levels, this dialog is where you can load predefined
cave terrain templates (e.g. "Cave 1", "Cave 2") that provide
pre-built terrain geometry and textures as a starting point.

TIP: Experiment with different presets before fine-tuning individual
parameters. The vanilla game includes many atmospheric setups you can
study and modify.


================================================================================
  SECTION 6 — MODE SELECTION BAR  (The Four Main Modes)
================================================================================

The Mode Selection Bar is located on the left side of the editor
window. It contains four buttons that switch between the editor's
main editing modes. You will constantly cycle between these.


MODE 1: TERRAIN SHAPE AND TEXTURE  (Mountain Icon)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────
This is the combined terrain sculpting and texture painting mode.
When active, the left panel shows brush settings and texture slots.

SCULPTING:
  • Left click + drag:  Raise terrain
  • Shift + Left click: Lower terrain
  • Brush controls in the left panel:
      Shape:   Circular, square, diamond, etc. (switch with NumPad 1)
      Size:    Radius of the brush effect
      Power:   Strength of each brush stroke
      Density: How many vertices are affected (switch with NumPad 0)

  • Use Ctrl+R to toggle Random Brush mode for more organic results.
  • The editor supports custom stamps (see Section 8).

TEXTURING:
  • Select a texture from the slots in the left panel.
  • Paint on the terrain with Left Mouse Button.
  • Multiple texture layers can overlap — each paint stroke blends
    with existing textures.
  • Use the Texture Set Manager (Section 7) to change which textures
    are available in the slots.


MODE 2: LIQUID POOLS  (Water Drop Icon)
───────────────────────────────────────
This mode allows you to create bodies of water and lava.

  • Click and drag to define a water/lava area.
  • Water height can be set globally via console:
      editor.setwaterh 850
    (850 is a typical default value)
  • Water color can be set via:
      Editor.SetWaterColor R G B
    (Values as floats: 1 0 0 = red, 0 0 1 = blue)

  • To remove all water: Tools → Remove Water


MODE 3: COLORS  (Palette Icon)
──────────────────────────────
This mode allows you to free-paint colors directly onto the terrain.
This is separate from texture painting — it applies a color tint
overlay to the existing textures.

  • Select a color from the Color picker.
  • Paint on the terrain with Left Mouse Button.
  • Useful for adding subtle color variation to landscapes, marking
    paths, or creating visual effects.
  • For underground levels, the terrain color system is critical:
    White = visible/accessible terrain, Black = void/inaccessible.
    (See Dungeon Guide for details.)

  Console commands for colors:
    Editor.FillWorldWithColor 0xFFFFFFFF    (fill all with white)
    Editor.FillWorldWithColor 0xFF000000    (fill all with black)
    Editor.ReplaceColor oldColor newColor   (batch color swap)


MODE 4: OBJECTS  (Cube Icon)
────────────────────────────
This mode is for placing all content objects in your level:
buildings, trees, rocks, NPCs, markers, furniture, props, creatures,
and everything else that populates the world.

  • The left panel becomes the Objects browser with categories.
  • Click an object to select it for placement.
  • Left click on the terrain to place it.
  • Use the NumPad controls to position, rotate, and adjust.
  • Shift + Left Click on a highlighted object to DELETE it.

The Objects browser contains thousands of items organized in
categories. Browse carefully — many useful objects are hidden in
sub-categories you might not expect.

For marker placement (teleport destinations, spawners, etc.), markers
are also found in the Objects section. Toggle marker visibility with
Alt+M.


================================================================================
  SECTION 7 — TEXTURE SYSTEM  (Texture Sets & Management)
================================================================================

The editor's texture system is based on Texture Sets — predefined
collections of terrain textures, grass/foliage billboards, and lava
textures that work together.

ACCESS
──────
Click the "Setup textures set" button at the top of the left panel
when in Terrain Shape and Texture mode.


THE TEXTURE SET MANAGER
───────────────────────
The manager window has three main areas:

  LEFT COLUMN — Texture Slots
  ────────────────────────────
  Lists all textures in the current set, divided into three groups:

    1. Terrain Textures:  16 slots for ground textures (grass, rock,
       dirt, snow, sand, cobblestone, etc.)

    2. Grass/Foliage:     8 slots for 3D billboard textures (grass
       blades, bushes, ferns, flowers, etc.)

    3. Lava Textures:     4 slots for lava/magma surfaces.

  CENTER — Render Preview
  ───────────────────────
  A real-time preview window showing the selected texture in detail.
  Also displays 3D billboard textures (grass, bushes) for accurate
  visualization of how they will look in-game.

  RIGHT COLUMN — Available Sets
  ─────────────────────────────
  Lists all available texture sets. Click on a set to load it into
  the left column slots.

  BOTTOM — Terrain Textures Browser
  ──────────────────────────────────
  Lists all individual .dds texture files available in the game.
  Select one and use the Add button to add it to the current set.

MANAGING TEXTURES
─────────────────
  Add (+) Button:    Select a texture in the Terrain Textures browser,
                     then click Add to insert it into the current set.

  Delete (-) Button: Highlight a texture in the current set (red box
                     appears in render), then click Delete to remove.

  Texture Set Name:  Enter a name for your custom set.
  Save Set:          Save the current set with the entered name.
  New Set:           Clear all textures for a fresh start.
  Reload:            Reload the currently selected set. You MUST reload
                     after any modifications for changes to take effect.
  Close:             Close the Texture Set Manager.

WARNING: Do NOT modify and overwrite an original game texture set.
Always save as a new name to avoid corrupting game data.

TEXTURE LOCKING
───────────────
You can lock textures to prevent accidental painting over them:

  Console: Editor.LockTexture 7 1
    (Lock texture 7: 1=locked, 0=unlocked)

This is useful when you want to paint new textures without disturbing
existing ones.


================================================================================
  SECTION 8 — STAMPS SYSTEM  (Advanced Brushes)
================================================================================

One of the editor's most unique features is the Stamp system. Stamps
allow you to use any 3D model from the game as a terrain brush. This
means you can stamp body shapes, rock formations, building outlines,
or any other mesh onto the terrain — both for sculpting and texturing.

ACCESS
──────
The Stamps section is in the bottom area of the Texture Set Manager.
There are 15 stamp slots, each corresponding to a number on the
Stamp selection pad in the main editor panel.

HOW TO SET UP A CUSTOM STAMP
─────────────────────────────
  1. Open the Texture Set Manager (Setup textures set button).

  2. FIRST: Change the texture set name and save as a new set.
     This prevents overwriting an original game set.

  3. Find the "translateStampObject" field for the stamp slot you
     want to assign (00 through 14).

  4. Click the "..." button next to it to open the model file browser.

  5. Browse the game's model folders and select a .vdf file (the
     game's 3D model format). Any model can be used — characters,
     objects, environmental pieces, anything.

  6. Click Open to assign the model as a stamp.

  7. Save and Reload the texture set.

  8. Back in the editor, select the stamp number you assigned and
     start painting/sculpting. The brush will use the 3D model's
     shape.

EXAMPLE USE CASES
─────────────────
  • Use a rock formation model as a stamp to create natural-looking
    rocky terrain by stamping it across a hillside.
  • Use a path or road model to quickly lay down road shapes.
  • Use body or character models for... creative terrain sculpting.

The Specials folder in the stamp browser contains additional
predefined stamp shapes beyond the Default set.


================================================================================
  SECTION 9 — OBJECTS AND THEIR PLACEMENT  (Complete Guide)
================================================================================

Objects are everything that exists on your level beyond the terrain
itself — buildings, trees, rocks, NPCs, markers, furniture, light
sources, sound emitters, and hundreds of other items.


THE OBJECTS BROWSER
───────────────────
When in Objects mode (Mode 4), the left panel becomes the Objects
browser. Objects are organized in a tree structure with categories
and subcategories. Major categories include:

  • Environment:   Trees, rocks, grass patches, natural formations
  • Buildings:     Houses, castles, towers, walls, bridges
  • Furniture:     Tables, chairs, beds, shelves, barrels, crates
  • Characters:    NPCs, enemies, animals, creatures
  • Markers:       Teleport destinations, spawners, triggers
  • Effects:       Particle emitters, light sources, sound objects
  • Props:         Weapons, armor, items, treasures, chests
  • Dungeon:       Cave entrances/exits, dungeon-specific objects

Browse thoroughly — many useful objects are nested deep in sub-
categories.


PLACING OBJECTS
───────────────
  1. Find and click the desired object in the browser.
  2. Move the mouse to the desired position in the viewport.
  3. Left-click to place the object.
  4. Use the NumPad to fine-tune position and rotation (Section 2).

SELECTING & MANIPULATING
────────────────────────
  • Hover the mouse over an object — a red highlight bar appears.
  • Press Numpad 5 to select it (color changes to confirm).
  • Use NumPad keys to move, raise, lower, and rotate.
  • Press Numpad Del to deselect.

DELETING OBJECTS
────────────────
  • Hover over an object until highlighted (red bar visible).
  • Press Shift + Left Click to delete it.

OBJECTS VS. MARKERS
───────────────────
This is a critical distinction for beginners:

  Objects are visible in-game — the player can see and sometimes
  interact with them (buildings, trees, chests, NPCs).

  Markers are invisible in-game — they serve as data points that
  control game behavior (spawn locations, teleport targets, triggers,
  quest markers). You can only see them in the editor when Draw
  Markers (Alt+M) is enabled.

Common marker types:
  • MARKER_TELEPORT_DEST_FROMUPPER  — dungeon entry point
  • MARKER_TELEPORT_DEST_FROMLOWER  — dungeon exit return point
  • Spawner markers (animal spawner, enemy spawner)
  • Quest markers
  • Sound markers

CONSOLE COMMANDS FOR OBJECTS
────────────────────────────
  Editor.SetDrawMapMarkers MARKER_ENEMY_* 0xFFFF0000
    Highlight all enemy markers in red on the map view.

  Editor.SetDrawMapObjects OBJ_ID_* 0xFFFF0000
    Highlight specific object types on the map.

  editor.MapMarkerSize 2
    Change marker display size for better visibility.

  Editor.DeleteBadMarkers
    Remove broken/invalid markers.

  Editor.DeleteAllObjects objectID
    Remove all instances of a specific object type.

  Editor.ReplaceObject old new
    Replace all instances of one object with another.

  createEd x y z alpha [beta phi] objectID [meshVariant] [meshScale]
    Place an object at exact coordinates via console.
    z == 0 means ground level.


================================================================================
  SECTION 10 — FAQ  (Common Questions from the Community)
================================================================================

These answers come from the TW modding community (Discord) and
address the most common questions new editors have.


Q: How do gates behave?
───────────────────────
It depends on context:
  • In existing villages and castles: Gates can automatically open
    when the player approaches.
  • Outside populated areas: Gates stay closed, but the player can
    manually open/close them.
  • In custom-built structures: Gates will most likely NOT auto-open.
    The player must interact with them manually.


Q: How do chests and loot work?
───────────────────────────────
  • Place chest objects from the Objects section.
  • Players can open any placed chest by lock-picking.
  • Loot content is ALWAYS randomly generated based on the player's
    current character level.
  • You do NOT control what specific items appear — only whether
    a chest exists at that location.


Q: How do I place working enemies?
───────────────────────────────────
There are two methods, but only one works properly:

  CORRECT: Use Spawner Markers
  Place spawner markers (found in the Markers section of the Objects
  browser). These generate living, active enemies at their location
  when the game runs.
    • Standard enemies: 2-6 spawn per marker
    • Tough enemies/giants: 1-3 spawn per marker

  WRONG: Place NPC Models Directly
  If you place an NPC character model directly, it will appear in-game
  but will be completely inert — it stands still like a statue. It
  won't move, patrol, or react unless directly attacked. The NPC's
  name will also display as generic/unusual text.

  ALWAYS use spawner markers for functional enemies.


Q: My objects are floating / sunk into the ground!
───────────────────────────────────────────────────
Use NumPad + and - to raise and lower objects. Some objects have
their origin point offset, so they may need manual height adjustment.
You can also use the console command to batch-adjust:

  editor.AddZToAll xxx
  (adds a height offset to all objects on the level)

After placing objects, always run Alt+U (Update Terrain Passing) and
Alt+W (Update Walkable Objects) to ensure proper collision.


Q: Where are the save files?
─────────────────────────────
The editor saves levels to the Saves\Levels\ folder inside your game
directory. The file format is .lnd (level data) with an accompanying
.bmp (minimap bitmap). The editor adds an "s" suffix to filenames
(e.g. Map_F01s.lnd) — this must be removed when building a mod.


================================================================================
  SECTION 11 — CONSOLE COMMANDS  (Beginner-Friendly Selection)
================================================================================

The console is opened with the C key. It supports auto-complete:
start typing a command and matching options appear. You can also
execute script files with @ (e.g. @edundgr.txt).

  SECTION 12 — NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

Now that you understand the editor, here is where to go next:


TO MAKE YOUR MAP PLAYABLE
─────────────────────────
Follow the "TW1 Map to Mod Conversion Guide" for the complete
process: cook PhysX, generate LevelHeaders, copy and rename files,
pack into .wd archive, and activate via registry.


TO CREATE DUNGEONS / CAVES
──────────────────────────
See "TW1 Dungeon Creation Guide Part 1" for the manual method
(creating underground levels within the main editor), and
"Part 2" for the SDK's dedicated Dungeon Editor tool.


TO MODIFY GAME PARAMETERS
──────────────────────────
The game's data (units, items, skills, AI, combat) is defined in
TwoWorlds.xls in the Parameters folder. Edit with Microsoft Excel,
then compile with the Makra.xls macro to generate TwoWorlds.par.
WARNING: Parameter changes affect game balance significantly and
should be tested thoroughly.


TO CREATE CUSTOM 3D MODELS
──────────────────────────
Install the Maya plugins from the MayaPlugins folder. See the
Maya plugins readme.txt in Documentation for setup instructions.
Models are exported as .vdf files.


TO EDIT QUESTS
──────────────
Use WhizzEdit from the WhizzEdit folder. Requires .NET Framework 2.0.
Contains quest data from version 1.5.


TO EDIT SCRIPTS (Game Logic)
────────────────────────────
Use EarthC.exe to compile and EarthCdbg.exe to debug EarthC scripts.
The Scripts folder contains source files from version 1.5.
